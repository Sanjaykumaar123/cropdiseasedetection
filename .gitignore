# Dataset and Models
dataset/
# Keep the model if it's not too huge, but usually we ignore large artifacts. 
# User asked to push the project, they might expect the model. 
# GitHub limit is 100MB. plant_disease_model.pth might be small (MobileNetV2 is ~14MB).
# So I will NOT ignore the model folder for now, but I will check its size.
